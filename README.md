# Instrument Workshop

This project is a demo for a fictional instrument workshop bussiness. The main purpose of it was to implement a complex style of design 
initially created in Adobe XD by a designer. The project was built using React.js and is a simple SPA app. 

## Structure of the project

The project is structured in pages and components

Pages:
* Home

Components: 

* Rotating Slider
* Navbar
* Expanded Component

While the project only implements a single page of this fictional store the intent was for the structure of the code to reflect how I would 
structure a project such as this.

The **rotating slider** is the central piece of this project, as sliding between the instruments causes various changes to occur in the app such as
color changes and text changes. The rotating slider is a personal implementation.
